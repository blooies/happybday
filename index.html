    <h2>Happy Birthday Kan!</h2>

      Dear Kan,
      <p class='indent'>Happy birthday!! I feel like I already know you since Johnathan always talks so much about you at work! And don't worry- it's all good things :) Just to let you know it was totally my idea to get you an iPad case! I actually had a really tough time picking it out becuz there's just so many choices on Amazon and it was very overwhelming lol. I wasn't sure if you wanted a transparent case (so you can see the gold backing of your iPad) or a colored case. And then Johnathan said you might prefer a case that comes with a flap, but they didn't have that style in transparent. So I asked Johnathan what your favorite color is and ended up just getting you a pink case lol. I hope you like it! Anyways, hope you have an awesome birthday! Johnathan called you an "old lady" but you definitely do not look like it! Haha</p>
      -Beverly
